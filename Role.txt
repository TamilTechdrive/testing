Role:
You are a senior database architect designing a scalable Test Management System for embedded platforms.

Task:
Generate a top-to-bottom ER diagram (database schema visualization) with clearly defined entities, primary keys, foreign keys, and relationship cardinalities.

Constraints:

Test cases must never be duplicated

Variants are allowed

Same test case may be executed multiple times (trials)

Each execution records step-level results

Test execution is hardware, platform, and software version dependent

Test cases may validate external specifications (Freeview, Freesat, DVB, etc.)

Test plans and containers are logical groupings, not ownership

Entities and Relationships (Top → Bottom)
1. SPECIFICATION

Represents standards or compliance rules.

spec_id (PK)

spec_code (FREEVIEW, FREESAT, DVB)

spec_name

Visualization Instructions

Draw entities top-to-bottom

Show PK/FK explicitly

Use crow’s foot notation for cardinality

Highlight logical vs physical entities

Ensure no circular ownership

Output:
A clean, professional ER diagram suitable for architecture review and implementation.
